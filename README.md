# Menu
### Main menu:
When the user runs the program they will open to the main menu. This shows all the programs that the computer can run. The menu tells the user to choose one of the applications to run, the user must enter the number of the application they want to run. If the user enters a valid number then the application they asked for will be ran, however if they enter invalid data they will be asked again for a number. 

### Shaun Q1 (Players goals over a season):
When the user chooses this application, they will be asked for the full name of the player they would like the stats for. Once this has been done (remember to use capital letters), they will be asked for the season they would like the stats for. This database has data from 2014 to 2020 so you must choose one of these. If invalid data is input then the user will be told what data was invalid before being sent back to the start of the menu. If valid data is entered then the line chart of the players goals over that season will be output.

### Shaun Q2 (Types of goals over a season):
When the user chooses this application, they will be asked for the league they would like to information for. Once this is entered they will be asked for the season they would like the stats for. This database has data from 2014 to 2020 so you must choose one of these. If invalid data is input then the user will be told what data was invalid before being sent back to the start of the menu. If valid data is entered then the pie chart of the types of goals over the season will be output.

### Matthew Q1 (Teams points over a season)
On selection of this application the user will be asked to enter a team they would like to check and a season they would like to check. The dataset ranges from 2014-2020, if the progran find the data required then it will produce a visualisation showing the selcted teams points over the selected season. If it it cannot find the data it will either ask the user to re-enter the data or reset to the main menu.

### Matthew Q2 (Players XG vs G)
On selection of this application the user will be asked to enter a season they would like to check. The dataset ranges from 2014-2020, if the progran find the data required then it will produce a visualisation showing the selected season and all the players with their xG plotted against their goals. If it it cannot find the data it will either ask the user to re-enter the data or reset to the main menu.

### Callum Q1 (A teams home and away goals in a season)
On selection of this application the user will be asked to enter a team they would like to check and a season they would like to check. The dataset ranges from 2014-2020, if the progran find the data required then it will produce a visualisation showing the selcted teams home goals and away goals over the selected season. If it it cannot find the data it will either ask the user to re-enter the data or reset to the main menu.

### Callum Q2 (Shot conversion rate for a team in a season)
On selection of this application the user will be asked to enter a team they would like to check and a season they would like to check. The dataset ranges from 2014-2020, if the progran find the data required then it will produce a visualisation showing the selcted teams shot conversion rate for each game over the selected season. If it it cannot find the data it will either ask the user to re-enter the data or reset to the main menu.

### Maria Q1 (Shot results by situation):
When the user runs this visualisation, they will be prompted to enter a season between 2015 and 2020.
Once a valid season is entered, the program filters the dataset to only include matches played during that season.
It then extracts shot data, grouping each shot by its situation (such as open play, set piece, or penalty) and its result (goal, saved, blocked, etc.).A grouped bar chart will be generated to show how different shot situations lead to different outcomes.If the user enters an invalid season (e.g., a year outside the available range or in the wrong format), the program will notify them and exit cleanly, allowing for another attempt.

### Maria Q2 (Team discipline(Yellow and Red Cards)):
When the user selects this visualisation, they will be prompted to enter the name of the team they would like to analyse. After entering a valid team name, the program will filter the dataset to include only matches involving that team. The script will then calculate the total number of yellow and red cards the team received in each season (between 2014 and 2020). A stacked bar chart will be displayed, clearly showing the team's disciplinary record across the seasons.If the user inputs an invalid or misspelled team name, the program will display a helpful message and stop gracefully, allowing the user to restart.

### Joe Q1 (Leagues Ranked by Goal Situation):
If this option is chosen from the menu, the user is requested to input an option of 1 to 5, which is clearly displayed to them to each represent a different type of goal situation. These include corners, open play, direct freekicks, set pieces and penalties. Upon choosing an option the user is requested to input a year ranging from 2015 to 2019. After doing so the programme then displays a bar chart containing their selected data. They are then given the option to either close the programme or start again with a new choice of data.

### Joe Q2 (Types of Shot per Player):
If the user choose this option from the menu, they will be requested to input the name of any player that played within th available five leagues from 2015 to 2019. Upon entering a player name the programme will generate a well formatted pie chart that displays this chosen information. The user will then be given the option to either leave the programme of start the query again with a different player name.
